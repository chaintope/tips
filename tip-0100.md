## Abstract

This document defines how to implement Soulbound Tokens using Tapyrus'
[Colored Coin feature](https://github.com/chaintope/tapyrus-core/blob/master/doc/tapyrus/colored_coin.md) (NFT).

## Motivation

The idea of Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) has received a lot of attention.
On Tapyrus, NFT can be issued using the Colored Coin feature, but these tokens are transferable.
This TIP will allow for the issuance of SBT on Tapyrus by defining a common protocol for treating NFT on Tapyrus as SBT.

## Spec

This specification supports the following features of SBTs

* Publish: Enables an NFT to be issued as an SBT and allows its owner to prove that he/she owns the SBT.
* Non-transferable: Ensures that an issued SBF is not transferable by its owner.
* Revocable: Ensures that an issued NFT can be revoked (burned) by the issuer.

### Publish SBT

When issuing SBT in Tapyrus, lock the SBT into a script of the following form:

```
OP_IF
  <SBT owner public key> OP_RETURN
OP_ELSE
  <Issuer public key> OP_CHECKSIG
OP_END
```

where `SBT owner public key` is the public key of the owner of the issued SBT and
`Issuer public key` is the public key of the issuer of this SBT.
From the above script, create a CP2SH and issue an NFT to that address on Tapyrus.
Both `SBT owner public key` and `Issuer public key` must be 33-byte compressed public keys.

As in above script, `SBT owner public key` branch (`OP_IF` branch) contains `OP_RETURN` opcode.
So although the public key information of the SBT owner is known,
the SBT cannot be transferred using this public key. This guarantees non-transferability.

#### Issuer limitation

The identifier of a Tapyrus NFT (Color ID) is computed from the OutPoint of the first input of the issuing transaction.
This specification requires that the `Issuer public key` be the same public key
that is pushed in the script sig of the input used to calculate the Color ID,
in order to guarantee that the `Issuer public key` is that of the issuer of the NFT.
Specifically, the UTXO used to issue the SBT must be in P2PKH format (this restriction may be relaxed in the future)
and the corresponding public key and `Issuer public key` must be identical.

If the issuer is not a single entity, it is possible for multiple entities to become issuer
by using the aggregate public key of all issuers as the `Issuer public key`.
In case of revocation, it is necessary to generate an aggregate signature by all entities.

### Revocation

Revocation of an SBT by the issuer is accomplished by the issuer using the `Issuer public key` (`OP_ELSE` branch)
to burn the SBT.
If the SBT is transferred without burning by the `Issuer public key`, the SBT is invalidated as an incorrect SBT transfer.

### Proof of SBT ownership

Proof of ownership of an SBT is proven by signing an arbitrary message using the `SBT owner public key` of the script
whose SBT you own is locked.

The following data is required for the proof:

* OutPoint (TXID + output index) of SBT's UTXO
* An redeem script and scriptPubkey of SBT's UTXO (CP2SH)
* Message to be signed
* A valid digital signature (ECDSA or Schnorr signature) for the message and `SBT owner public key`

The proof process for SBT owner (prover) and verifier is as follows:

1. The prover provides to verifier with the SBT UTXO OutPoint and the SBT UTXO (CP2SH) scriptPubkey and redeem script of it.
2. The verifier checks:
   * The target UTXO is an unused UTXO of the SBT issued transaction.
   * The scriptPubkey type must be CP2SH and NFT.
3. After passing the verification, send the message `m` as a signing request to the prover.
The verifier must always generate a new message.
This prevents an attacker who does not know the private key and reuse the digital signature of a prover obtained by some means to pass verification.
4. The prover uses the private key corresponding to the `SBT owner public key` in the redeem script
to generate a digital signature (ECDSA or Schnorr signature) for the message to be signed.
Then sends the generated digital signature to the verifier.
5. The verifier checks that the received digital signature is a valid digital signature against the
`SBT owner public key` in the redeem script received in messages `m`.
Once you pass the verification, you are verified as the owner of the SBT.

Note: During signing and signature verification, the message must be SHA-256 hashed and used as the signature digest.
