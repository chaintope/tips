## Abstract

Define cointype of BIP-0044 for Tapyrus. I suppose to `2377` as cointype.

## Motivation

Now, there is no cointype defined for Tapyrus in BIP-0044. So, It is confusing what number is set to cointype when implementing HDWallet for tapyrus.

I propose to cointype for Tapyrus. But we need consensus in this community before pushing to [SLIP-0044](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md).

## Specification

Register `coin_type` below:

| Coin type | Path component (`coin_type'`) | Coin               |
|-------|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| 1     | 0x80000001                    | Dev |
| 15215628  | 0x80e82c0c                    | Tapyrus API         |
| 1939510133  | 0x739a9375                    | Tapyrus Testnet         |

## Rationale

The Tapyrus blockchain network is identified by a network ID, so we will use this ID as `coin_type`.

**Update:**

* 2026-01-22: Changed `coin_type` to the Tapyrus network ID instead of the RPC port, ensuring the network being used.
