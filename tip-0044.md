## Abstract

Define cointype of BIP-0044 for Tapyrus. I suppose to `2377` as cointype.

## Copyright

This TIP is licensed under the CC0 license.

## Motivation

Now, there is no cointype defined for Tapyrus in BIP-0044. So, It is confusing what number is set to cointype when implementing HDWallet for tapyrus.

I propose to cointype for Tapyrus. But we need consensus in this community before pushing to [SLIP-0044](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md).

## Specification

Register cointype below:

| Coin type | Path component (`coin_type'`) | Symbol | Coin               |
|-------|-------------------------------|--------|--------------------|
| 1     | 0x80000001                    |        | testnet(all coins) |
| 2377  | 0x80000949                    | TPC    | Tapyrus            |

## Rationale

The '2377' is Tapyrus RPC default port. So that, this number is easy to remember. And this number is not registered yet.
