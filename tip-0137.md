# Abstract

A standard for interoperable signed messages based on the Tapyrus Script format, either for proving fund availability, or committing to a message as the intended recipient of funds sent to the invoice address.

# Motivation

Since Tapyrus private keys can not only be used to sign Tapyrus transactions, but also any other message, it has become customary to use them to sign various messages for differing purposes. Some applications of signing messages with a Tapyrus private key are as follows: proof of funds for collateral, credit worthiness, entrance to events, airdrops, audits as well as other applications. 

This TIP proposes a standard signature format using a private key associated with a transaction output.

As a similar specification, Bitcoin defines BIP137[^1] and BIP322[^2] as methods of signing messages using private keys, but this specification uses JWS as the message format.


# Specification

This specification aims to demonstrate that the sender of a message holds the private key.
This key is capable of moving funds in a specific Tapyrus output.
We will first clarify the relationship between the private key for message signing and the Tapyrus output.

There is a Tapyrus output under consideration.
This output must have a script in scriptPubkey.
The script should be in either P2PKH (Pay to Public Key Hash) or CP2PKH (Colored Pay to Public Key Hash) format.
Additionally, the output must be unlockable by the message sender.

The sender uses the private key, which can unlock the output, to sign the message.
The signed message sent must include the TXID and the index of the output to identify the relevant Tapyrus output.

## Data Format

A signed message is formatted JSON Web Token (JWT) defined by RFC 7519[^3].
The message is represented as a string encoded in Base64url encoding and consists of three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature.

### Header

The header is a JSON object which has the same structure as the JOSE Header defined in JWS(RFC-7515)[^4].
The header has the following fields.

* typ (OPTIONAL)
  * The "typ" (type) Header Parameter is used by JWT applications to declare the media type of this JWT. This specification supports only "JWT"
* alg (OPTIONAL)
  * The "alg" (algorithm) Header Parameter identifies the cryptographic algorithm used to secure the JWS. This specification supports only "ES256K"
* jwk (REQUIRED)
  * The "jwk" (JSON Web Key) Header Parameter is the public key that corresponds to the key used to digitally sign the JWS. The format of JSON Web Key is defined by RFC 7517[^5]
  * jwk has the "keys" parameter, where keys is an array of keys used for signing. Each key is represented as a JSON object and have the following fields:
    * kty
      * The "kty" (key type) parameter identifies the cryptographic algorithm family used with the key, such as "RSA" or "EC". This specification supports only "EC"
    * crv
      * The "crv" (curve) parameter identifies the elliptic curve name. This specification supports only "P-256K"
    * x
      * The x-coordinate of public key. The value is base64url-encoded.
    * y
      * The y-coordinate of public key. The value is base64url-encoded.
    * use
      * The "use" (public key use) parameter identifies the intended use of the public key. This specification uses "sig"
    * alg
      * The "alg" (algorithm) parameter identifies the algorithm intended for use with the key. This specification supports only "ES256K"

### Payload

The payload is a JSON object called JWT Claims Set defined by JWT(RFC7519).
The payload has the following fields.

* txid (REQUIRED)
  * The "txid" (transaction ID) claim provides a identifier for the Tapyrus transaction. The "txid" value must be a 64-characters hexadecimal string.
* index (REQUIERD)
  * The "index" claim indicates output index in the transaction which is owned by the signer. The "index" must be  a non-negative integer.
* colorId (OPTIONAL)
  * The "colorId" claim indicates a color identifier of the transaction output. The "colorId" must be a 66-characters hexadecimal string.
* value (REQUIRED)
  * The "value" claim indicates the value of the transaction output. The "value" must be a non-negative integer.
* scriptPubkey (REQUIRED)
  * The "scriptPubkey" claim indicates the scriptPubkey script of the transaction output. The "scriptPubkey" must be a hexadecimal string. This specification supports only P2PKH and CP2PKH script pubkey.
* address(OPTIONAL)
  * The "address" claim indicates the address of the transaction output to prove ownership. The "address" must be a Base58 string.
* message(OPTIONAL)
  * Any message to be signed. The "message" value must be a hexadecimal string.

### Signature

The method of calculating the signature is defined in JWS.
ASCII(BASE64URL(UTF8(Header)) || '.' || BASE64URL(Payload)) is calculated with the HMAC SHA-256 algorithm and the result is base64url encoded.

### Example

The following is an example of Signed Message:

#### Header

The following is an example of a JSON object representing a header before it is encoded in Base64url:

```
{
  "alg": "ES256K",
  "typ": "JWT",
  "jwk": {
    "keys": [
      {
        "kty": "EC",
        "crv": "P-256K",
        "x": "TzVb3LfMCvco7zzOuWFdkGhLtbLKX4WasPC3BAdYcao",
        "y": "OFtrG46tgJymdFTZaD_PK6A0Vtb-LEq-Kwfw-9uy8cE",
        "use": "sig",
        "alg": "ES256K"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Payload

```
{
  txid: "f4184fc596403b9d638783cf57adfe4c75c605f6356fbc91338530e9831e9e16",
  index: 1,
  colorId: "c3ec2fd806701a3f55808cbec3922c38dafaa3070c48c803e9043ee3642c660b46",
  value: 1,
  scriptPubkey: "21c3ec2fd806701a3f55808cbec3922c38dafaa3070c48c803e9043ee3642c660b46bc76a91446c2fbfbecc99a63148fa076de58cf29b0bcf0b088ac",

  message: "00000000000000000000000000000000"
}
```

## Verification

A validator is given a JWT, then outputs one of the two states below.

* `valid` indicates that the signature is valid
* `invalid` means that some check failed

Validation consists of the following steps:

  1. Decode JWT form a `signedMessage` as the 3 parts: `header`, `payload`, and `signature`.
  2. Confirm the `header` satisfies the conditions.
       1. `typ` is `JWT`
       2. `alg` is `ES256K`
       3. `jwk`.`keys` is an array that has only element, and the element satisfieds the conditions:
          1. `kty` is `EC`
          2. `crv` is `P-256K`
          3. `use` is `sig`
          4. `alg` is `ES256K`
          5. The `x` and `y` coordinates can be recovered as a point on the elliptic curve specified by the `crv` element, which in this case is the secp256k1 curve.
  3. Confirm the `payload` satisfies the conditions.
        1. `txid` is a valid transaction id as 64-character hexdecimal string.
        2. `index` is non-negative integer less than 2^32.
        3. `colorId` is a valid color id as 66-character hexdecimal string. If `colorId` is included in `payload`, it should be equal to colorId in `scriptPubkey`
        4. `value` is non-negative integer less than 2^64.
        5. `scriptPubkey` is a valid P2PKH or CP2PKH script as hexdecimal string.
        6. `address` is a Base58 string.
        7. `message` is a hexdecimal string whose length is less than 1024.
  4. Confirm the `jwk` key corresponds to the public key hash in the `scriptPubkey` in the `payload`.
     1. Compress Public Key: Start by constructing a compressed public key binary from the `x` and `y` coordinates found in the `jwk`.
     2. Apply Hash Functions: Subject the binary representation of the compressed public key to a series of hash functions, specifically SHA-256 followed by RIPEMD-160. This sequence is denoted as SHA-256(RIPEMD-160(public key binary)).
     3. Verify Public Key Hash: Ensure that the resultant hash value from step 2 matches the public key hash extracted from the `scriptPubkey`.
  5. Validate the JWS Signature(`signature`) against the JWS Signing Input ASCII(BASE64URL(`header`) || '.' || BASE64URL(`payload`)) in the manner defined for the algorithm `ES256K`.
  6. Validate the `payload` on the Tapyrus blockchain
     1. The transaction output indicated by the `txid` and `index` exists on the Tapyrus blockchain.
     2. The `value`, `scriptPubkey`, and `address` are equal to those in the transaction output mentioned above.

## Signing

A signer who control an address A and wish to sign a message `m` act as follows:

  1. Encode a `header` as BASE64URL(UTF8(`header`)).
  2. Encode a `payload` as BASE64URL(`payload`).
  3. Concatenate the `header` and the `payload` with a period ('.') character.
  4. Pass two parameters the `concat(header.payload)` and a `private key` to the ECDSA signing function. The result is the DER-format ECDSA digital signature.
  5. Encode the signature as BASE64URL(JWS Signature).
  6. Concatenate these values in the order `header`.`payload`.`signature` with period ('.') characters.

This signing process requires a `private key` consisting of randomly generated numbers. 
The private key used in this process must be identical to the private key used to unlock the transaction output.
In Tapyrus, the private key is a single unsigned 256-bit integer (32 bytes).
