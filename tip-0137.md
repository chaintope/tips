# Abstract

A standard for interoperable signed messages based on the Tapyrus Script format, either for proving fund availability, or committing to a message as the intended recipient of funds sent to the invoice address.

# Motivation

# Specification

## Data Format

Signed Message is a JSON Web Token (JWT) defined by RFC 7519[^1]
A message is represented as a string encoded in Base64url encoding and consists of three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature.

### Header

Header is a JSON Object which has the same structure as the JOSE Header defined in JWS(RFC-7515)[^2]
Header has the following 2 fields.

* typ (OPTIONAL)
  * The "typ" (type) Header Parameter is used by JWT applications to declare the media type of this JWT. This specification supports only "JWT"
* alg (OPTIONAL)
  * The "alg" (algorithm) Header Parameter identifies the cryptographic algorithm used to secure the JWS. This specification supports only "ES256K"

### Payload

Payload is a JSON Object called JWT Claims Set defined by JWT(RFC7519)
Payload has the following fields.

* txid (REQUIRED)
  * The "txid" (transaction ID) claim provides a identifier for the Tapyrus transaction. The "txid" value is a 64-characters hexadecimal string
* index (REQUIERD)
  * The "index" claim indicates output index in the transaction which is owned by the signer. The "index" is a non-negative integer.
* colorId (OPTIONAL)
  * The "colorId" claim indicates a color identifier of the Utxo. The "colorId" is a 66-characters hexadecimal string
* value (REQUIRED)
  * The "value" claim indicates the value of the Utxo. The "value" is a non-negative integer.
* scriptPubkey (REQUIRED)
  * The "scriptPubkey" claim indicates the scriptPubkey script of the Utxo. The "scriptPubkey" is a hexadecimal string
* address(OPTIONAL)
  * The "address" claim indicates the address of the Utxo to prove ownership. The "address" is a Base58 string.
* data(OPTIONAL)
  * Any message data to be signed. The "data" value is a hexadecimal string.

### Signature

### Example

The following is an example of Signed Message:

#### Header

The following is an example of a JSON object representing a header before it is encoded in Base64url:

```
{
  "alg": "ES256K",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

#### Payload

```
{
  txid: "f4184fc596403b9d638783cf57adfe4c75c605f6356fbc91338530e9831e9e16",
  index: 1,
  colorId: "c3ec2fd806701a3f55808cbec3922c38dafaa3070c48c803e9043ee3642c660b46",
  value: 1,
  scriptPubkey: "21c3ec2fd806701a3f55808cbec3922c38dafaa3070c48c803e9043ee3642c660b46bc76a91446c2fbfbecc99a63148fa076de58cf29b0bcf0b088ac",
  address: "22VdQ5VjWcF9zgsnPQodFBS1PBQPaAQEXSofkyMv2D9zV1MLp3JfScV6TMVaUQ42xeTfjieWssAaefMd",
  data: "00000000000000000000000000000000"
}
```

#### Signature(Encoded in Base64url format)

## Verification

A validator is given as input a JWT and public key, and outputs one of two states

* `valid` indicates that the signature is valid
* `invalid` means that some check failed

Validation consists of the following steps:

  1. Decode JWT form `signedMessage` as the 3 parts: `header`, `payload`, and `signature`
  2. Confirm `header` satisfies the conditions.
       1. `typ` is `JWT`
       2. `alg` is `ES256K`
  3. Confirm `payload` satisfies the conditions.
        1. `txid` is a valid transaction id as 64-character hexdecimal string.
        2. `index` is non-negative integer less than 2^32
        3. `colorId` is a valid color id as 66-character hexdecimal string.
        4. `value` is non-negative integer less than 2^64
        5. `scriptPubkey` is a valid script as hexdecimal string.
        6. `address` is a Base58 string.
        7. `data` is a hexdecimal string whose length is less than xxxx.
  4. Validate the JWS Signature(`signature`) against the JWS Signing Input ASCII(BASE64URL(`header`) || '.' || BASE64URL(`payload`)) in the manner defined for the algorithm `ES256K`.
  5. Validate `payload` on Tapyrus Blockchain
     1. The transaction output indicated by `txid` and `index` exists on the Tapyrus Blockchain.
     2. `value`, `scriptPubkey`, `address` are equal to those in the transaction above:

## Signing

Signers who control an address A who wish to sign a message `m` act as follows:

  1. Encode `header` as BASE64URL(UTF8(`header`))
  2. Encode `payload` as BASE64URL(`payload`)
  3. Concatenating `header` and `payload` with a period ('.') character, 
  4. Pass two parameter `concat(header.payload)` and `private key` to ECDSA signing function. The result is the DER-format ECDSA digital signature.
  5. Encode the signature as BASE64URL(JWS Signature)
  6. Concatenating these values in the order `header`.`payload`.`signature` with period ('.') characters
