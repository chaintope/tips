# Abstract

A standard for interoperable signed messages based on the Tapyrus Script format, either for proving fund availability, or committing to a message as the intended recipient of funds sent to the invoice address.

# Motivation

Since Tapyrus private keys can not only be used to sign Tapyrus transactions, but also any other message, it has become customary to use them to sign various messages for differing purposes. Some applications of signing messages with a Tapyrus private key are as follows: proof of funds for collateral, credit worthiness, entrance to events, airdrops, audits as well as other applications. 

This TIP proposes a standard signature format using private key associated with utxo.

As a similar specification, Bitcoin defines BIP137[^1] and BIP322[^2] as methods of signing messages using private keys, but this specification uses JWS as the message format.


# Specification

## Data Format

Signed Message is a JSON Web Token (JWT) defined by RFC 7519[^3]
A message is represented as a string encoded in Base64url encoding and consists of three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature.

### Header

Header is a JSON Object which has the same structure as the JOSE Header defined in JWS(RFC-7515)[^4]
Header has the following 2 fields.

* typ (OPTIONAL)
  * The "typ" (type) Header Parameter is used by JWT applications to declare the media type of this JWT. This specification supports only "JWT"
* alg (OPTIONAL)
  * The "alg" (algorithm) Header Parameter identifies the cryptographic algorithm used to secure the JWS. This specification supports only "ES256K"

### Payload

Payload is a JSON Object called JWT Claims Set defined by JWT(RFC7519)
Payload has the following fields.

* txid (REQUIRED)
  * The "txid" (transaction ID) claim provides a identifier for the Tapyrus transaction. The "txid" value is a 64-characters hexadecimal string
* index (REQUIERD)
  * The "index" claim indicates output index in the transaction which is owned by the signer. The "index" is a non-negative integer.
* colorId (OPTIONAL)
  * The "colorId" claim indicates a color identifier of the Utxo. The "colorId" is a 66-characters hexadecimal string
* value (REQUIRED)
  * The "value" claim indicates the value of the Utxo. The "value" is a non-negative integer.
* scriptPubkey (REQUIRED)
  * The "scriptPubkey" claim indicates the scriptPubkey script of the Utxo. The "scriptPubkey" is a hexadecimal string
* address(OPTIONAL)
  * The "address" claim indicates the address of the Utxo to prove ownership. The "address" is a Base58 string.
* data(OPTIONAL)
  * Any message data to be signed. The "data" value is a hexadecimal string.

### Signature

The method of calculating the signature is defined in JWS.
ASCII(BASE64URL(UTF8(Header)) || '.' || BASE64URL(Payload)) is calculated with the HMAC SHA-256 algorithm and the result is base64url encoded.

### Example

The following is an example of Signed Message:

#### Header

The following is an example of a JSON object representing a header before it is encoded in Base64url:

```
{
  "alg": "ES256K",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

#### Payload

```
{
  txid: "f4184fc596403b9d638783cf57adfe4c75c605f6356fbc91338530e9831e9e16",
  index: 1,
  colorId: "c3ec2fd806701a3f55808cbec3922c38dafaa3070c48c803e9043ee3642c660b46",
  value: 1,
  scriptPubkey: "21c3ec2fd806701a3f55808cbec3922c38dafaa3070c48c803e9043ee3642c660b46bc76a91446c2fbfbecc99a63148fa076de58cf29b0bcf0b088ac",
  address: "22VdQ5VjWcF9zgsnPQodFBS1PBQPaAQEXSofkyMv2D9zV1MLp3JfScV6TMVaUQ42xeTfjieWssAaefMd",
  data: "00000000000000000000000000000000"
}
```

#### Signature(Encoded in Base64url format)

```

## Verification

A validator is given as input a JWT and public key, and outputs one of two states

* `valid` indicates that the signature is valid
* `invalid` means that some check failed

Validation consists of the following steps:

  1. Decode JWT form `signedMessage` as the 3 parts: `header`, `payload`, and `signature`
  2. Confirm `header` satisfies the conditions.
       1. `typ` is `JWT`
       2. `alg` is `ES256K`
  3. Confirm `payload` satisfies the conditions.
        1. `txid` is a valid transaction id as 64-character hexdecimal string.
        2. `index` is non-negative integer less than 2^32
        3. `colorId` is a valid color id as 66-character hexdecimal string.
        4. `value` is non-negative integer less than 2^64
        5. `scriptPubkey` is a valid script as hexdecimal string.
        6. `address` is a Base58 string.
        7. `data` is a hexdecimal string whose length is less than xxxx.
  4. Validate the JWS Signature(`signature`) against the JWS Signing Input ASCII(BASE64URL(`header`) || '.' || BASE64URL(`payload`)) in the manner defined for the algorithm `ES256K`.
  5. Validate `payload` on Tapyrus Blockchain
     1. The transaction output indicated by `txid` and `index` exists on the Tapyrus Blockchain.
     2. `value`, `scriptPubkey`, `address` are equal to those in the transaction above:

## Signing

Signers who control an address A who wish to sign a message `m` act as follows:

  1. Encode `header` as BASE64URL(UTF8(`header`))
  2. Encode `payload` as BASE64URL(`payload`)
  3. Concatenating `header` and `payload` with a period ('.') character, 
  4. Pass two parameter `concat(header.payload)` and `private key` to ECDSA signing function. The result is the DER-format ECDSA digital signature.
  5. Encode the signature as BASE64URL(JWS Signature)
  6. Concatenating these values in the order `header`.`payload`.`signature` with period ('.') characters
