# Abstract

A standard for interoperable signed messages based on the Tapyrus Script format, either for proving fund availability, or committing to a message as the intended recipient of funds sent to the invoice address.

# Motivation

Since Tapyrus private keys can not only be used to sign Tapyrus transactions, but also any other message, it has become customary to use them to sign various messages for differing purposes. Some applications of signing messages with a Tapyrus private key are as follows: proof of funds for collateral, credit worthiness, entrance to events, airdrops, audits as well as other applications. 

This TIP proposes a standard signature format using private key associated with a transaction output.

As a similar specification, Bitcoin defines BIP137[^1] and BIP322[^2] as methods of signing messages using private keys, but this specification uses JWS as the message format.


# Specification

## Data Format

A signed message is formatted JSON Web Token (JWT) defined by RFC 7519[^3].
The message is represented as a string encoded in Base64url encoding and consists of three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature.

### Header

The header is a JSON object which has the same structure as the JOSE Header defined in JWS(RFC-7515)[^4].
The header has the following two fields.

* typ (OPTIONAL)
  * The "typ" (type) Header Parameter is used by JWT applications to declare the media type of this JWT. This specification supports only "JWT"
* alg (OPTIONAL)
  * The "alg" (algorithm) Header Parameter identifies the cryptographic algorithm used to secure the JWS. This specification supports only "ES256K"

### Payload

The payload is a JSON object called JWT Claims Set defined by JWT(RFC7519).
The payload has the following fields.

* txid (REQUIRED)
  * The "txid" (transaction ID) claim provides a identifier for the Tapyrus transaction. The "txid" value must be a 64-characters hexadecimal string.
* index (REQUIERD)
  * The "index" claim indicates output index in the transaction which is owned by the signer. The "index" must be  a non-negative integer.
* colorId (OPTIONAL)
  * The "colorId" claim indicates a color identifier of the transaction output. The "colorId" must be a 66-characters hexadecimal string. This specification supports only P2PKH and CP2PKH script pubkey.
* value (REQUIRED)
  * The "value" claim indicates the value of the transaction output. The "value" must be a non-negative integer.
* scriptPubkey (REQUIRED)
  * The "scriptPubkey" claim indicates the scriptPubkey script of the transaction output. The "scriptPubkey" must be a hexadecimal string. This specification supports only P2PKH and CP2PKH address.
* address(OPTIONAL)
  * The "address" claim indicates the address of the transaction output to prove ownership. The "address" must be a Base58 string.
* data(OPTIONAL)
  * Any message data to be signed. The "data" value must be a hexadecimal string.

### Signature

The method of calculating the signature is defined in JWS.
ASCII(BASE64URL(UTF8(Header)) || '.' || BASE64URL(Payload)) is calculated with the HMAC SHA-256 algorithm and the result is base64url encoded.

### Example

The following is an example of Signed Message:

#### Header

The following is an example of a JSON object representing a header before it is encoded in Base64url:

```
{
  "alg": "ES256K",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

#### Payload

```
{
  txid: "f4184fc596403b9d638783cf57adfe4c75c605f6356fbc91338530e9831e9e16",
  index: 1,
  colorId: "c3ec2fd806701a3f55808cbec3922c38dafaa3070c48c803e9043ee3642c660b46",
  value: 1,
  scriptPubkey: "21c3ec2fd806701a3f55808cbec3922c38dafaa3070c48c803e9043ee3642c660b46bc76a91446c2fbfbecc99a63148fa076de58cf29b0bcf0b088ac",
  address: "22VdQ5VjWcF9zgsnPQodFBS1PBQPaAQEXSofkyMv2D9zV1MLp3JfScV6TMVaUQ42xeTfjieWssAaefMd",
  data: "00000000000000000000000000000000"
}
```

#### Signature(Encoded in Base64url format)

## Verification

A validator is given a JWT and a public key as inputs, then outputs one of the two states below.

* `valid` indicates that the signature is valid
* `invalid` means that some check failed

Validation consists of the following steps:

  1. Decode JWT form a `signedMessage` as the 3 parts: `header`, `payload`, and `signature`.
  2. Confirm the `header` satisfies the conditions.
       1. `typ` is `JWT`
       2. `alg` is `ES256K`
  3. Confirm the `payload` satisfies the conditions.
        1. `txid` is a valid transaction id as 64-character hexdecimal string.
        2. `index` is non-negative integer less than 2^32.
        3. `colorId` is a valid color id as 66-character hexdecimal string.
        4. `value` is non-negative integer less than 2^64.
        5. `scriptPubkey` is a valid script as hexdecimal string.
        6. `address` is a Base58 string.
        7. `data` is a hexdecimal string whose length is less than xxxx.
  4. Validate the JWS Signature(`signature`) against the JWS Signing Input ASCII(BASE64URL(`header`) || '.' || BASE64URL(`payload`)) in the manner defined for the algorithm `ES256K`.
  5. Validate the `payload` on the Tapyrus blockchain
     1. The transaction output indicated by the `txid` and `index` exists on the Tapyrus blockchain.
     2. The `value`, `scriptPubkey`, and `address` are equal to those in the transaction output mentioned above.

This validation process requires a `public key` provided by the signer.
This public key must be identical to the public key used to generate the output address of the transaction
Only public keys in compressed form (33 bytes) may be used in this specification.

## Signing

A signer who control an address A and wish to sign a message `m` act as follows:

  1. Encode a `header` as BASE64URL(UTF8(`header`)).
  2. Encode a `payload` as BASE64URL(`payload`).
  3. Concatenate the `header` and the `payload` with a period ('.') character.
  4. Pass two parameters the `concat(header.payload)` and a `private key` to the ECDSA signing function. The result is the DER-format ECDSA digital signature.
  5. Encode the signature as BASE64URL(JWS Signature).
  6. Concatenate these values in the order `header`.`payload`.`signature` with period ('.') characters.

This signing process requires a `private key` consisting of randomly generated numbers. 
The private key used in this process must be identical to the private key used to unlock the transaction output.
In Tapyrus, the private key is a single unsigned 256-bit integer (32 bytes).
